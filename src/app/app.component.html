  <h1>Apple Pay</h1>

  <p>Before you start, you need to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://stripe.com/docs/stripe-js/elements/payment-request-button#html-js-testing" target="_blank">Add a payment method to your browser.</a> For example, add a card to your Wallet for Safari.</li>
    <li>Serve your application over HTTPS. This is a requirement both in development and in production. One way to get up and running is to use a service like <a href="https://ngrok.com/" target="_blank">ngrok</a>.</li>
    <li><a href="https://stripe.com/docs/stripe-js/elements/payment-request-button#verifying-your-domain-with-apple-pay" target="_blank">Verify your domain with Apple Pay</a>, both in development and production.</li>
  </ul>
